Google Cybersecurity Certificate 

Welcome to my journey and interpretations of code and cybersecurity. 
I am happy that you are taking the time to investigate on what I know and who I am. 

I started studying for the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, not really knowing what I am getting my self into, however it seemed all natural since I was able to pick up 90% of what was taught in the course by the people that protect Google's data.

The Google Cybersecurity Certificate has eight courses that focus and build upon core concepts and skills related to the daily work of cybersecurity professionals, including foundational cybersecurity models and frameworks that are used to mitigate risk; protecting networks and data; using programming to automate tasks; identifying and responding to security incidents; and communicating and collaborating with stakeholders. Additionally, I applied what I have been tought in each course by completing portfolio projects that can be used to showcase my understanding of essential cybersecurity concepts to potential employers.
