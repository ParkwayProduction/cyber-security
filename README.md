Google Cyber Security Certificate

Welcome to my completed skill-shop exercises and interpretations of code and security tasks.â€¨I am happy that you are taking the time to investigate on what I know and who I am. 

I started studying for the Google Cyber Security Certificate not really knowing what I am getting my self into but it seemed all natural since I was able to pick up 90% of what was taught at this course by the people that protect Google's data.
